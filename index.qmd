Welcome to my webpage!

<p align="justify">
I am a predoctoral research fellow at Stanford GSB.
I am interested in applied microeconomics, causal inference, and machine learning applications in economics.
You can call me either *Wooyong* or *Tommy*. 

Usual disclaimer applies: all posts here represent my own opinions and do not reflect the views of any of my past or present affiliations.
</p>

<p align="justify">
p.s. I have recently switched my github username from *wyeconomics* to *wooyongp*, so a lot of connections to my repos or GitHub pages might have become lost. If you have these issues, you can try redirecting to my new username.
</p>
