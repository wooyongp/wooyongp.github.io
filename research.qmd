  <summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>This study evaluates the impact of South Koreaâ€™s small and medium enterprise
(SME) support policies on firm survival and performance by leveraging the exogenous
shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using administrative data from the SMEs Inte-
grated Management System (SIMS), we analyze the effectiveness of various SME sup-
port programs, including technology, human resources, export, domestic sales, startup,
and management support. To address endogeneity, we exploit the natural experiment
created by COVID-19; to mitigate selection bias, we restrict the sample to firms that
received financial support in 2019 and examine how the timing of support (across
2019 quarters) affects outcomes. If firms receiving support closer to the pandemic show
greater improvements, this suggests a policy effect rather than selection bias. Our re-
sults indicate that technology and domestic sales support are significantly associated
with higher employment, revenue, and firm survival. We also examine complementarity
and substitutability among support policies, finding significant interactions for certain
combinations.</p>
