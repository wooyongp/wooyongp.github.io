Today, I presented a paper written by Professors Susan Athey, Mohsen Bayati, Nikolay Doudchenko, Guido Imbens, and Khashayar Khosravi on matrix completion methods with my friend Wonjin Seo at Yonsei University - Applied Micro RG. It was a great experience to share our thoughts and ideas on the paper. I hope you find these slides and MC helpful for your own research.
