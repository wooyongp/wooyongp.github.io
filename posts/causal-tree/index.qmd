Today, I presented a paper written by Professors Susan Athey abd Guido Imbens on causal trees and honest algorithm with my friends Joonwoo Shin, Jeongwoo Yang, and Minseo Seok at Yonsei University - Junior Scholar Club. It was a great experience to share our thoughts and ideas on the paper. I hope you find these slides and causal tree helpful for your own research.
