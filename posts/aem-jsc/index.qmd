I started out this study group in July(2024) with students in the Economics department who aim for attaining PhD in Applied Economics. We are planning to have this study group every twice a year, passing on the materials and resources to future students as well. I gave presentations on topics including ***clustering standard errors*** and ***staggered difference-in-differences***.
